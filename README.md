 # Console Based App - Student Management System
 
 The aim of this project is to be able to work with classes, use several built in methods and work with arrays.
 
 The project idea is to have a system where a user would be able to pick one option from the menu, select 1,2,3...etc and 
 be able to do the following:  

   * ```Input student info```
   * ```Lookup a particular student by studentID```
   * ```Remove a particular student by studentID```
   * ```Register student for courses```
   * ```Add student grades for courses```
   * ```Display all students```
   * ```Sort students by GPA```
   * ```Quit```
   
## Part 1 - Complete Student.java class

In the files attached you will find a Student.java file that you need to work on. The Course.java class finilized for you, you don't need to work on it.
It has most of the comments you will need to complete the class.
 
## Part 2 - Complete StudentValidator.java class

Work on a StudentValidator class. The class has just one single method: 

   * ``` public static boolean valdiateBirthDate(String date)```
  
This method should validate the date to make sure it's the correct format.
It will then be used in a class from Part 3 below to make sure the user would input the correct date format. 
Since the method is static, you will be executing it like this: ```StudentValidator.validateBirthDate("10-12-2020");```
(you don't have to instantiate the class to call the method)

## Part 3 - Complete StudentDataOperator.java class

This class has several methods. Each has a "TODO" comment. Read the comments and follow the instructions.

## Part 4 - Run the Main.java class

You don't need to add any code to the Main.java class. It's been completed for you.
I would recommend running the Main method every time you make any changes to your program (reasonable changes) to see what effect this particular 
code you've written has on the program overall.
